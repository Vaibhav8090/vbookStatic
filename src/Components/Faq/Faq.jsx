              To get a better idea of the cost of what you want to build, give
              us a quick phone call. We’ll ask you a few questions about the
              nature of the site, what sort of interactivity the site will have,
              your graphic design needs, etc. Then we’ll be able to give you a
              ballpark figure. If you’re still interested, we’ll come to your
              place of business and come up with a firm quote.

              The time limit of any assignment is normally dictated by the
              client. If you have any time limit in mind we will attempt to
              assemble it for you. The main general delay in the making of a
              website is waiting for the content of the pages to be sent to us
              by the client.

              For most projects, equal payments are made at the start, midway,
              and the end of the project, but we can work with you to set up a
              schedule that meets your needs. We understand that this is a big
              investment and want to help you budget for the expense in whatever
              way possible. We accept checks, PayPal, and all major credit
              cards.
